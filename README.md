## Introduction

This software engineering and artefact-oriented development-based project will develop a location-oriented and data recording app. Flutter/Dart will be used for the front end with Solid server technology for the backend to store data in a privacy focussed way. It will be a live app in that it will actively collect location pings regularly, and provide chart analysis function.
