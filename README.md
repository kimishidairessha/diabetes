# SecureDiaLog Diabetes Monitoring Application

This project is a privacy oriented diabetes data collection and
analysis application (ios/android) using SOLID to help individuals
manage their diabetes.

## Introduction

This software engineering and artefact-oriented development-based
project will develop a location-oriented and data recording
app. Flutter/Dart will be used for the front end with Solid server
technology for the backend to store data in a privacy focussed way. It
will be a live app in that it will actively collect location pings
regularly, and provide chart analysis function.

## Software Description

The application records users' personal data through daily questionnaires.
The historical data is displayed in real-time charts and stored encrypted 
in a Solid pod. Users have complete control over their data, and the app 
also provides analytics based on the historical data to assess and 
improve the diabetes status of the users.
