# Klee's Location

This project is a privacy oriented location data collection and analysis application (ios/android) using SOLID.  

## Introduction

This software engineering and artefact-oriented development-based project will develop a location-oriented and data recording app. Flutter/Dart will be used for the front end with Solid server technology for the backend to store data in a privacy focussed way. It will be a live app in that it will actively collect location pings regularly, and record nearby identified bluetooth devices (as the location-based data for example).

The location data collected by the app will be mapped within the app using OpenStreetMap. A user can use PODs data sharing to aggregate a collection of “friends” data for privacy preserving location analysis.
